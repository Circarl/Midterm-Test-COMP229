    <br> 
</p>



##  About <a name = "about"></a>

This is midterm test for web application development course, COMP229, at Centennial College. The project is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a list of books. The project is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.


### Set up the Project:

Initialize new Node.js project using npm:

```
npm init
```
and install necessary dependencies, in this test I used express and mongoose:

```
npm install express mongoose
```
### Seting up Express app and Create the server file:

Using POSTMAN to test the API endpoints
